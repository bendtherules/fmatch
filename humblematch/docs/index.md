Will **Sanitize your type-checks and duck-checks** for you

Available at [HumbleMatch@pypi]()


## What the heck is it?

HumbleMatch is made to *add a zing* to your mundane type-checking and duck-checking code.

* Check your function arguments reliably, add *more flexible signatures* and most of all, have a lovely API.
* Or just *sprinkle some assert* checks to ensure the data is what you expect it to be at any point.
* Provide helpful debugging errors, *dont just fail with cryptic errors*
